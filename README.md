Simple Text Classification

A basic sentiment analysis project using Scikit-learn with **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**. Text is preprocessed using **TF-IDF**, and models are evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and classification reports. The dataset includes minimal sample reviews (e.g., “Great movie!” vs. “Bad acting.”).
